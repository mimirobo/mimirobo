# 🧠 Code. Automate. Innovate.

💡 I’m Mohammed Esmaeili, a seasoned software engineer passionate about building reliable and creative software across diverse domains.  
My expertise spans three core areas: designing robust .NET backend and full-stack systems, developing Qt/QML applications for HMI and embedded/IoT devices, and advancing robotic solutions with ROS2 for navigation, perception, and control.  
I also have experience leading AI initiatives, focusing on system architecture and integrating machine learning into real-world applications.  
This unique blend enables me to seamlessly integrate software infrastructure, intelligent automation, and user-centric design in complex projects.
